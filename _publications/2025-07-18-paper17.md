To address the challenges of complex low-altitude flight environments for UAVs, where numerous obstacles often lead to GPS signal obstruction and multipath effects, this study proposes an integrated inertial navigation and GPS positioning approach for coordinated cross-path planning in drone swarms. The methodology involves the following: (1) discretizing continuous 3D airspace into grid cells using occupancy grid mapping to construct an environmental model; (2) analyzing dynamic flight characteristics through attitude angle variations in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system; and (3) implementing collaborative state updates and global positioning through fused inertial–GPS navigation. By incorporating Cramér–Rao lower bound optimization, the system achieves effective cross-path planning for drone formations. Experimental results demonstrate a 98.35% mission success rate with inter-drone navigation time differences maintained below 0.5 s, confirming the method’s effectiveness in enabling synchronized swarm operations while maintaining safe distances during cooperative monitoring and low-altitude flight missions. This approach demonstrates significant advantages in coordinated cross-path planning for UAV clusters.
