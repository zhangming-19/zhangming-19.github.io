excerpt: 'With the development of pre-trained language models and large-scale datasets, automatic text summarization has attracted much attention from the community of natural language processing, but the progress of automatic summarization evaluation has stagnated. Although there have been efforts to improve automatic summarization evaluation, ROUGE has remained one of the most popular metrics for nearly 20 years due to its competitive evaluation performance. However, ROUGE is not perfect, there are studies have shown that it is suffering from inaccurate evaluation of abstractive summarization and limited diversity of generated summaries, both caused by lexical bias. To avoid the bias of lexical similarity, more and more meaningful embedding-based metrics have been proposed to evaluate summaries by measuring semantic similarity. Due to the challenge of accurately measuring semantic similarity, none of them can fully replace ROUGE as the default automatic evaluation toolkit for text summarization. To address the aforementioned problems, we propose a compromise evaluation framework (ROUGE-SEM) for improving ROUGE with semantic information, which compensates for the lack of semantic awareness through a semantic similarity module. According to the differences in semantic similarity and lexical similarity, summaries are classified into four categories for the first time, including good-summary, pearl-summary, glass-summary, and bad-summary. In particular, the back-translation technique is adopted to rewrite pearl-summary and glass-summary that are inaccurately evaluated by ROUGE to alleviate lexical bias. Through this pipeline framework, summaries are first classified by candidate summary classifier, then rewritten by categorized summary rewriter, and finally scored by rewritten summary scorer, which are efficiently evaluated in a manner consistent with human behavior. When measured using Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall rank coefficients, our proposal achieves comparable or higher correlations with human judgments than several state-of-the-art automatic summarization evaluation metrics in dimensions of coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance. This also suggests that improving ROUGE with semantics is a promising direction for automatic summarization evaluation.'
