excerpt: 'Switched-capacitor (SC) PUF has been used in the protection of security chips from invasive attacks due to their capacitive sensitivity. However, non-volatile memory cells are often used to bypass the unstable SC PUF units, which then become insensitive to outside attacks, creating a vulnerability that can be exploited by probing or Focus Ion Beam (FIB) attacks, thereby posing a potential security risk if these units are used to cover sensitive areas of the security chip. This paper proposes a method to increase stability while maintaining anti-invasive-attack capabilities by utilizing the configurability of the four capacitors in each SC PUF unit, and selecting the configuration that provides a larger mismatch of capacitor ratios, resulting in a larger output voltage mismatch. By doing so, the variation of offset for the latch-styled sense amplifier (LSSA) is suppressed, and the stability of the SC PUF is significantly increased. Additionally, changing the polarity of the LSSAâ€™s inputs to match its offset also increases the effective input voltage of the LSSA. The proposed SC PUF using optimal capacitor configuration is fabricated using a 12 nm FinFET CMOS process. Test results demonstrate that the bit error rate of the SC PUF is reduced from about 17% to about 1.5%, and most of the SC PUF units can serve as anti-invasive-attack shields of the security chip.'
